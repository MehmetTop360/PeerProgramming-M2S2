# PeerProgramming-M3S2

## Setup

**Note:** For this exercise, we have provided an `.env` file with the database connection string. Normally, you would not commit this file to version control. We are doing it here for simplicity and given that we are using a local SQLite database.

## Database

This project should be used with the `movies.db` database in `data/` folder. It is the same database that we used in the previous exercise. You can download a fresh database [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2022/fall/psets/7/movies.zip) or from [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/7/movies/).

## Migrations

We can run migrations with the following command:

```bash
npm run migrate:latest
```

## Running the server

In development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In production mode:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Updating types

If you make changes to the database schema, you will need to update the types. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm run generate-types
```
